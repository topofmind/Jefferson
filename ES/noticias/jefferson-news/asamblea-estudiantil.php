                <p><span class="firstLeter">A</span>s part of a class government activity, the Student Council carried out a Student Assembly addressing three topics: well-being, academic and social coexistence. This year a virtual assembly was presented to students from 7th to 11th grade. This innovative proposal had very good results among the student body. This is another way, in which students have the opportunity to be heard, discuss and propose possible solutions.</p>

                <p>Afterwards, the Student Council must meet, analyze the proposals and organize them in a unified document delivered to the Principal, who will evaluate its feasibility and outline a plan.</p>
