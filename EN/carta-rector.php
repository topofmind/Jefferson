					<p> <span class="firstLeter">A</span>t Colegio Jefferson we have a firm commitment to form our students as reflective social beings with criteria, so that they become proactive and impact society in a positive way.</p>

 					<p>This assignment that we assume as educators is crossed by the sense that each of us, who are part of this important project, prints into his/her work. That is why as teachers, we do not limit ourselves to transmit information but to generate knowledge and experiences for life in each one of our students. There is no absolutely truth for a mentor. Thomas Jefferson once said: <b>Enlighten the people generally</b>, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day‚Äù; and this may be oru purpose.</p>

 					<p>We recognize our students in their particularity and we ensure that they reach the autonomy of thought and action in which we believe. We are convinced that practicing freedom with responsibility allows us to be respectfull of the dignity of othersand the envornment and thus, contribute to the construction of a peaceful society.</p>
