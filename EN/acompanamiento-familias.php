			<p><span class="firstLeter">I</span>thaca is the metaphor Colegio Jefferson uses when naming the meetings held between the Psychology team and students and their families. Psychologists chose the Greek poem by Constantine Peter Cavafy because it invites us to think of life as a journey where we are transformed and where <span class="pItaca">the importance lies in the process itself and not the outcome.</span> We embrace this metaphor because students and their parents embark on a 14 year journey full of transformation and life experiences along their trip in school.</p>

					<p>The Psychology team guides students, parents and teachers along different meetings such as workshops, group talks, small groups and one on one talks to reflect, share and come to agreements on the type of counsel and support students require according to the moment they are living.</p>
					<p>Psychology provides a specific guidance to students all along their school years, which also makes part of our institutional proposal. Every level team and psychologists meet to think and create pedagogical projects that will help guide every student and establish the necessary counsel for their families. Seminars aimed at prevention education are also carried out with professionals such as Redpapaz, la Corporaci√≥n Caminos, Profamilia and ICT Ministry. </p>
