							<p><span class="firstLeter">I</span>n 2017, the school began a selection process in which a group of students was invited to design and renovate the image of our school mascots. The process of making the cartoon, receiving advisory over the importance of mascot branding and finally voting took almost a year!</p>
	
							<p>Creativity and hard work was given by our students throughout the process. In the end, <b>Maria Kanaseki’s</b> design won the contest (11th grade student). </p>
