						<p><span class="firstLeter">T</span>he fundamental pillar of our pedagogical project is language, understanding it as an element that can build universes and that touches every dimension in a human being. In that sense, we acknowledge learning Spanish, English and French as the ability to build solid foundations that give meaning to a culture. Our students are immersed in different languages ​​with teachers from different nationalities, whose mother tongue is French and English, they provide not only the basic knowledge of the language, but also an invaluable cultural awareness.</p>

					<p>When our children arrive to Preschool they start their bilingual process with Spanish and English, having contact with both languages ​​simultaneously and to the same extent. When they arrive to Junior, French is introduced as a third language, this allows them to graduate with proficiency certifications in both languages.</p>
					
					<p>During their school life, our students present tests administered by the University of Cambridge and the French Ministry of Education, like: KET (Key English Test), PET (Preliminary English Test), IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and DELF ( diplôme d'études en langue française).</p>
