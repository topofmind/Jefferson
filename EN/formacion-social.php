				<h2>Social Program</h2>

				<p class="left">
				<span class="firstLeter">B</span>uilding educational moments and social entrepreneurship for our Jefferson community.
				</p>

				<p>The social program makes part of a well-rounded pedagogical proposal we provide our students and which makes part of the academical process. We carry out two-way encounters that allow children the opportunity to share different knowledge and narratives about the way they face various situations, taking into account the emotional bond as a fundamental principle.</p>

				<p>In order to bring to school a historical, economical and contextual awareness of the social development of our community, these encounters are held with different institutions and foundations. These encounters provide new experiences for our students, there is a transformation in their words, in their ideas, in their feelings and in their representations. Accordingly, the social program allows the Jefferson community to make part of society through a more human and civic role, with the purpose of generating changes.</p>
