				<p><span class="firstLeter">T</span>o celebrate the AdvancED accreditation everyone worked so hard on, we met a couple of times. The first one was an internal celebration, we thanked our pedagogical and administrative teams for being part of our institution and for joining us on this journey of continuous improvement. The second one was a gathering to thank the coordinators, academic council, board of directors, students, parents, government entities and the media for the constant support throughout this process.</p>
