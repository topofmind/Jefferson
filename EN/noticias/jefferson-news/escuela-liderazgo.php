A few days ago, some of the secondary/high school teenagers participated in the Leadership and Communication workshop held at Universidad Icesi. This workshop aims to offer new knowledge, tools and skills to structure projects for the community. This first stage will be complemented in the coming months with activities at School such as public speaking, argumentation and conflict resolution, followed by visits from leaders to share experiences and will end with a project design.</p>
