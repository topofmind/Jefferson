				<p><span class="firstLeter">O</span>ur Social Studies and Spanish Literature teacher, Jaime Núñez, delights both students and different audiences with his poems. Jaime has always been passionate about reading, history, writing and especially poetry. However, he confessed that he retired for a while in order to concentrate on his master's in Ancient History. Later, he focused on writing argumentative essays while working at Universidad del Valle. When he joined Colegio Jefferson, the pedagogical proposal required him to return to his passion, writing poems and stories and thus becoming a reference to his students.</p>
				
				<p>A few months ago, Jaime participated in the contest “Escritores Autónomos” organized by Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, winning second place in the category “Poesía en Español”. Now, he is participating in the “Festival Internacional de Poesía de Cali” Along with artists from all over the world, they have recited poetry in different settings, such as universities and schools.</p>

				<p><span>Congratulations Jaime! We are really proud of you being part of our Community!.</span></p>
