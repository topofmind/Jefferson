				<p><span class="firstLeter">I</span>n order to create a close bond between families and the pedagogical team, we started our school year with an Open House in each grade. In this way, our parents have the opportunity to meet the whole team of teachers, psychologists and coordinators who will accompany their children during the year. In addition, the pedagogical proposal and the proposed methodology are shared at the Open House. This allows both parents and educators to be aware of the challenges our children will face, establish agreements and strengthen the family-school relationship, which is essential in the education process.</p>
