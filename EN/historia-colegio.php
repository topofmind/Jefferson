					<p><b class="textInline">Our History:</b></p>
					<p>Our history began years ago in 1961, when William Johnson founded the Instituto Interamericano, designed for teaching English to adults. It all started in a house located in Granada, one of the most traditional neighborhoods in Cali. When Mr. Johnson and his family decided to go back to the United States, teachers and students from the institute resolved to turn it into a school.</p>
 
					<p>In 1963 young and dynamic Thomas Houser undertook the direction of the school and changed its name to Jefferson School. By that time, Mr. Roland Schambach was a member of the board of directors, and convinced his only neighbor to donate land for a new school. This man was Harold Zangen, and that’s how we started our history in Arroyohondo.</p>

					<p>When all the Jefferson family arrived, nothing was built. Mr. Houser, parents, teacher and students started the first building with their own hands. It was an admirable and hard work experience for all the members of our community.</p>
					
					<p>In 1977 Jefferson School changed its name to Colegio Jefferson, the one that remains to this day and that gave us our traditional CJ symbol.</p>

					<p><b><i> ¡We feel really satisfied that this year our beloved school completes 55 years of educating well rounded citizens!</i></b></p>

							<p>Thomas Jefferson was one of the brightest men of his time; he was the third president of the United States of America and is considered an American Founding Father. He was an advocate of critical thinking and human rights. He also played an important role in America’s independence from Great Britain, being the primary author of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

						<div class="contHistoria ">
							
							<p>Due to the many characteristics and distinctive symbols that represent our school, in 1968 directors launched a call for students to design our badge. The result was a magnificent drawing by the student Eloy Echegurren. The Jaguar along with the CJ symbol in a book, a couple of pens and the mountains that surround us are the main symbols in our distinctive emblem. The one that we use today is a faithful copy of the original drawing by Eloy and it has only been updated to be used in marketing materials.</p>

								<img src="../img/historiaColegioJaguar.jpg" alt="">
							</div>
							<p>The jaguar was chosen because of its crucial role as a keystone species in the food web across Latin America. After the school badge was designed, a group of parents decided to adopt the jaguar that resided at Zoológico de Cali, at that time. It was given the name Jeff and money was donated until it died.</p>

						<div class="contHistoria ">

							<p>When we arrived to Arroyohondo, we discovered that this place was the natural habitat for many iguanas. They were everywhere! We also found out that these iguanas were not as common as they seemed. They are a rare type that has adapted to the low temperatures in the afternoons and at night. Iguanas are now an emblematic icon of our history and stunning reminder of our commitment to the environment.</p>
